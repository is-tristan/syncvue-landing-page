		description="<p><strong>Built with the wholesale markets, not adapted from retail.</strong> SyncVue was built in response to real problems raised by traders we already work with.</p> <p>Ish Sea Food, a trader at Billingsgate Market, told us about the daily struggle of tracking invoices, part payments, and credit customers in a fast-moving market environment. That same problem came up again and again across the industry.</p> <p>We spent time on the ground speaking with traders at Billingsgate, Smithfield, Spitalfields, and similar wholesale markets, understanding how payments really work and where time and money are lost.</p> <p>SyncVue is the result of that research and hands-on experience — a simple solution built specifically for wholesale market traders, not adapted from retail or office-based systems.</p>"
