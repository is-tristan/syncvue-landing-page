						<h2>SyncVue End-User License Agreement</h2>
						<p><strong>Last Updated: 26 January 2026 </strong></p>
						<p
							>This Privacy Policy (“Policy”) describes how SyncVue Ltd (“SyncVue” ,

							software application (the “App”), which operates in conjunction with the
							Clover point-of-sale system. This Policy applies solely to personal data

							extent permitted by applicable law.
