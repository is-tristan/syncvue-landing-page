						<h2>1. The App</h2>
						<p

							the management of wholesale transactions by integrating point-of-sale systems
							with accounting platforms. It connects payment terminals with accounting software
							to create a unified flow of transaction and invoice data, reducing the need
							for manual data entry and reconciliation.The platform enables businesses to
							link invoices to card payments, monitor payment status, and track outstanding
							balances in near real time. By automating the matching of invoices, payments,
							and settlement data, SyncVue helps users identify unpaid or partially paid
							invoices more efficiently and maintain accurate financial records. SyncVue
							is intended to reduce administrative workload, improve financial visibility,
							and minimise errors associated with manual processing. It does not replace
							accounting software or payment services, but acts as an integration layer
							that facilitates data synchronisation between supported systems in accordance
							with user configuration and permissions.</p
